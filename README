description: Extra keyboard button handler for Windows - One press to close top window
I used to have 2 different keyboards with many extra buttons and no use for them. This is one of the useful actions to attach to one of them. 

content: 
  1. copy CloseTopWindow.exe to some permanent location - for example:C:\Program Files\CloseTopWindow\CloseTopWindow.exe
  2. register you keyboard handler to execute the file on special button press event (it can be also global shortcut as F11..)
  3. use the advantage of useful shortcut (one extra button instead of Alt+F4 or using mouse)
